# Russian travel
**About**

Russia occupies 1/6 of the land and, definitely, there are many picturesque places on its territory that are worth visiting. Yes, these places do not have worldwide popularity among tourists, but they are beautiful and interesting in their own way.
The project "Russian travel" was created as a service aimed at showing users an alternative to traveling to well-known world places. Moreover, the service contains links by clicking on which you can learn more about a particular place or how to get to it.

**Technologies used in the project:**
- HTML
- CSS
- Grid layout
- BEM
- Adaptive design

In this project, I practiced my skills in using gridlayout technology and adapting the site to different screen sizes. The project has been completed and will not be updated.
